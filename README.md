Steps to run code:

Make sure to run the code in its own folder and not a folder inside a folder; Should look like this

In vscode terminal run:

docker-compose down (to make sure you reset it)

docker-compose up -d 

Wait a bit then you will need to use http://localhost:8080/home (make sure its not already being used by anything else!)

Open up snowflake and run every sql line (in the sql file) up until the select statements aka just create db schema and table;

Then run the select statements in the sql file.
